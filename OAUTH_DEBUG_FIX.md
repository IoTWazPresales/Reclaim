# OAuth Loop Fix - Google Sign In

## Issue
Google OAuth keeps looping on accounts.google.com - redirect callback isn't being caught properly.

## Root Cause
1. Supabase OAuth returns code in query params: `reclaim://auth?code=...`
2. The deep link handler wasn't checking query params correctly
3. Need better logging to see what URL format is received

## Fixes Applied
1. ✅ Enhanced deep link handler with better logging
2. ✅ Check for OAuth code in query params first
3. ✅ Better error handling and logging
4. ✅ Multiple fallbacks for token parsing

## Testing Steps
1. Test Google OAuth again
2. Check console logs for "Deep link received:" message
3. Should see "OAuth code found, exchanging for session..." if callback works
4. If still looping, check Supabase redirect URI configuration
